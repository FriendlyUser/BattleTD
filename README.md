# Simple TD

A Simple Tower defence game made in unity, uses CI to deploy to github pages and hopefully hosted on AWS/GCP or heroku in the future.

Although, I had made several simple games before, now I think I want to design a TD game.

I have added Continuous Integration for releases and builds.

The web version is automatically deployed to dli-battle-td.surge.sh
